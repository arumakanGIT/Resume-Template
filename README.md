I’ve provided a collection of ready-to-use Photoshop (PSD) files that you can use in your projects

❌ To use this template, you must have Adobe Photoshop installed.

## How to Use

3. In Photoshop, open the Layers panel to view and edit all the fields included in the template.

## 

- For example, select the “name” layer.
Double-click it to enable text editing in Photoshop.
You can now replace the existing name with your own.

then save and close it.
